A growing responsability of Machine Learning scientists is to be aware of the inherent risk of algorithms,
especially in terms of ethics, bias and fairness.
I also realised that I don't know much about it.
Of course, I'm aware that models can be biased, and, working on genetic data, I'm know how careful we need to be with thee output of a model. However, there is much more to be said about that. so I decided to learn.

So I will try to read one book a week on that matter, and write a post about it.

The list of reading below will be updated over time, and please contribute to the list.

_This list has been inspired by Moritz Hardt in his [tutorial on fairness in AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igq_S_7IfOU&feature=youtu.be) at MLSS 2020._
