The primary focus of my PhD is the prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) using Machine Learning. [More]({% link research/protein-protein-interactions.md %})

I am also interested in the environmental impact of computer-based research.
We developped the Green Algorithms project to push forward the discussion around this issue.
More info [here]({% link research/green-algorithms.md %}) and on [www.green-algorithms.org](www.green-algorithms.org)

And I contribute to clinical studies to advise on statistical methodology.
