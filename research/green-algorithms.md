The Green Algorithms project aims at raising awareness about the carbon footprint of computational research,
as well as providing researchers with a [practical online tool](www.green-algorithms.org) to estimate their own emissions.

Our Methods manuscript is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07610) and we published a [blog article]({% post_url 2020-03-31-HDR-UK-blog-green-algorithms %}) for HDR-UK about this project.

I also gave several talks about this projects, with recordings available: [ESCS 2020](https://youtu.be/f9LOQ_L__ak), [Varsity Sci 2020](https://t.co/pYoZNE2hEL?amp=1).

_The Green Algorithm project is a joint effort with Jason Grealey and Mike Inouye._
