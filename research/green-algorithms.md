title: The Green Algorithms project
---

The Green Algorithm project was a joint effort with Jason Grealey and Mike Inouye.
Our goal is to raise awareness about the carbon footprint of computational research,
as well as providing researchers with a [practical online tool](www.green-algorithms.org) to estimate their own emissions.

We presented it in more on a blog article for HDR-UK, [here]({% post_url 2020-03-31-HDR-UK-blog-green-algorithms %}).
