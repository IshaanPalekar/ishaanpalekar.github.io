The Green Algorithms project aims at raising awareness about the carbon footprint of computational research,
as well as providing researchers with a [practical online tool](www.green-algorithms.org) to estimate their own emissions.

Our Methods manuscript is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07610) and we published a blog article for HDR-UK about this project, [here]({% post_url 2020-03-31-HDR-UK-blog-green-algorithms %}).

_The Green Algorithm project is a joint effort with Jason Grealey and Mike Inouye._
