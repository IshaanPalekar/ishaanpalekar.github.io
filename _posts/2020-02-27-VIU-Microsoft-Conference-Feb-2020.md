#  Microsoft Education Conference at Vancouver Island University

I attended this conference, presented by David Kozera & Greg Milligan mostly to learn more about Azure Active Directory, and management.

The scope of the conference was primarily focused on the k-12 & Post-Secondary education sectors in Canada. But I still learned a lot about some new 
technologies, methods, and applications that emphasize the change of on premises migration to the cloud.

Topics that were covered included:

- Azure Active Directory
- Identity security & privacy 
- Multifactor Authentication services
- Microsoft Teams overview and demo
- Threat protection using Sentinal 


It's always great to gain new insights, and trends in the industry I'm involved in. Some big takeaways from the conferene were:

- Carefully plan to execute a strategy to move to cloud with small project oriented milestones.

- Users in an administrative position with poor security practices are more likely to change their habits when
their bad habits are detrimental to the users data (students data).

- Microsoft Teams looks pretty decent as an all-in-one enterprise communication platform, with it's nice integration 
with Outlook Calendar, Whiteboards, and Sharepoint.

Looking forward to more tech conferences in 2020.
