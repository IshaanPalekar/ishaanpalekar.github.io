It is interesting that so many virtualization solutions either *use* or *start-out using* Linux as their base.  Xen uses Linux for Dom0, VMware's original ESX used Linux as the Service Console, Oracle VDI uses VirtualBox on Linux as a Type-2 hypervisor, and ***way*** back in the day, VMWare GSX/Server used Linux as it's base (also a Type-2 hypervisor.)
