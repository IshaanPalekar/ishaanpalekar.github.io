This past summer I really got into homelabs, specifically with Raspberry Pis. The Raspberry Pi 4 just came out and it's specs are better than ever - with up to 4GB or RAM, USB-C charging, and brand new ARM archetecture, makes it a powerful little machine.

I wanted to learn Docker, because..

- I was interested in seeing containerization in action

- Low overhead combined with Raspberry Pi 

- For fun
