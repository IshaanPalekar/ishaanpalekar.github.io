# Education:

I have a BSEE in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington in Seattle, WA.

# Work Experience:

My work experience includes both startup and large industries. I started work in IT as a sysadmin, before I moved into the industry. I was pre-IPO at Red Hat and worked there for over 5 years. I've worked in the semiconductor industry (always on software and operating systems) at Transmeta and at Philips Semiconductors (now NXP Semiconductors.) I worked at Bank of America as their Sr. Linux architect for 2 years and was a founding member of their Open Source Compliance and Management team.  I have significant experience with the design and deployment of VMware vSphere, including working for 3 years as the Principal Systems Engineer at a VMware Technology Partner whose product enables high-security and compliance-oriented virtualization deployments. I also have experience developing and deploying software development infrastructure (DevOps) and with development methodologies.

# Technical Experience:

I started working with Linux in 1993, and have used Linux at every job in my career since. I have been working with virtualization since 2007. I also have experience with other UNIX operating systems (HP-UX, Solaris, AIX) particularly around migrating solutions on those platforms to Linux. I am a Mac fan.
