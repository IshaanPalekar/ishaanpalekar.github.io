So, it looks like the ARM rumors played-out.  The PRO's won over the CON's it seems.  One aspect of the power-savings advantage I neglected to mention was the advantage of ARM big.LITTLE -- makes me wonder why Intel hasn't done something similar, except the nature of CISC probably makes it prohibitive.  Or there's a patent on it that prevents Intel from doing so.

We will see how this plays out in the real world.  I have no doubt that for "pure" Mac usage it will be great -- same for remote development.  However, I am wanting to see how targeting x86 from an ARM mac is going to work, given that I still believe that the majority of software will still be x86 for some time to come.
