title: "Hydra: A Trustless Decentralized Digital Identity System"
categories: academia

Hydra is an open-sourced system that will allow users to easily utilize a decentralized and secure authentication system to access services on the Internet. Hydra allows these services to easily authenticate users, and allows anyone to participate in the decentralized storage of user profile information. Hydra is resilient in the face of individual node failures, and prevents any party from impersonating another without possessing that partyâ€™s private key.

Current solutions for unified digital identities are insecure and have not been successful in reaching wide adoption. These solutions have several pitfalls due to being centralized and requiring the user to trust a third party.

By eliminating several of the problems associated with current identity providers, Hydra provides a pathway towards an Internet with a trustless, truly decentralized digital identity system.
