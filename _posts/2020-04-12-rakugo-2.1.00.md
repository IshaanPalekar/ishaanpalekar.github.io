## Version Numbering System Changed

Originally, version 2.1.00 was to give the opportunity to create adventure games (point & click) in addition to visual novel. But the changes that I make now are quite big, and in particular the fact that the large GUI will not be a singleton anymore, but a scene attached to others - it will facilitate the creation of games from genres other than visual novel from Rakugo. By the way, I can also change version numbering to 4 digits, which will be useful because I have an idea for a lot of small improvements graphical tools. The previous version 2.1.0 now becomes version 2.2.00.
