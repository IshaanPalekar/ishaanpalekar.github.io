This tutorial base on my conversation with [noodulz](https://noodulz.itch.io) creator of [Light Letters](https://noodulz.itch.io/light-letters-demo) using Rakugo.

## Create Rakugo Project 
1. [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download) needs to be downloaded and installed.
2. Download [Rakugo](https://jeremi360x.itch.io/rakugo/purchase) from official sources.
3. Open Godot and use the Import button to your right, then browse your files to find the Rakugo ZIP.

Godot will load the Rakugo template, but there is a known, easy to fix issue. Due to how Godot 3.x currently loads add-ons, it will not start Rakugo correctly the first time.
Simply close the project or restart Godot then reopen to load Rakugo correctly.
The shortcut for closing a project is **Ctrl + Shift + Q**.

## Project Structure

*The FileSystem tab is your main hub, use only this tab to change names or move files for your project.*

- *addons/Rakugo/* - the core code of Rakugo. You should leave this alone unless you know what you're doing.
- *fonts* - fonts assets used by GUI for text displays.
- *game* - Most of your game code and assets should be here.
- *graphics* - Graphical assets used by Rakugo
- *gui* - Your highly customizeable GUI. It can be used for whatever GUI a creator can think of.
- *themes* - Obsolete GUI themes from older Rakugo versions that will be removed or replaced in future versions.

## Rakugo Project Settings

To change game settings for your project, select *Project > Project Settings*

here is a new Rakugo category for the add-on content.
There are some obsolete options that will be fully removed in a future update.

### Obsolete Settings

- *rakugo/game/info/credits*
- *rakugo/editor/debug*

### Basic Settings

- *rakugo/game/scenes/scene_links* - this setting tells rakugo where the resources used by `Rakugo.SceneLoader.load_scene()` func are for easier scene changes.
- *rakugo/game/text/markup* - markup langue used in dialogs, Rakugo currently supports:
   - renpy (simplified due to godot limitations),
   - bbcode (with values in `<>`),
   - markdown( + bbcode),
   - markdown_simple( - bbcode)
- *rakugo/saves/test_mode* - if set true, save files will be saved as text files in your project folder for ease of testing. Set it to false before export.
    *rakugo/saves/save_folder* - it is the path for the project's save folder. Before exporting, change it to start from *user://* instead of  *res://*
