##Cool!
This is another test of my *cool* new workflow for writing in [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org).  I am getting the hang of things pretty quickly.

Some things I would like to change before it's done:

* Want to make sure the dialog is centered
* Turn it into a stand-alone app (maybe?)
* Grok some tags/options and present checkboxes (maybe?)
* Find out a way to make the cursor appear in the writing area

None of these are show-stoppers, but more of "nice to haves."

'till next time...
