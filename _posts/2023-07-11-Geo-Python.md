## Geo-Python

I've taken a liking to Geographical and spatial data recently. I've been playing with ArcGIS and QGIS and wanted to apply a way to programatically interact and learn more.

I found that The University of Helsinki has a [Geo-Python](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) course available online, all for free. 

The course offers an introduction to Python in the geographical sense. It goes through the basics of programming, and then goes onto more geospatial topics like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

All lesson materials are available as git repos, which can be pulled to have a local copy, and the course utilizes Jupyter Notebooks as an IDE and workbook to go through problems.

I've gained a lot of great knowledge from this course and it's really opened my eyes up about practical approaches to data visualization within the GIS field.
