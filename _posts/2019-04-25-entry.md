## Experiment 1: Anethetizing cuke

### Materials and Reagents
 | Qty| unit | Item                    | Qty| unit   | Item               |
 | ---| ---  |  ---                    | ---| ---    |                --- |
 | .5 | grams| menthol                 |  3 | handful| ice                |
 | 1  | liter| of Artificial sea water |  2 | liter  | glass beaker       |
 | 1  |      |stir plate and stir bar  |    |        |                    |

### Protocol:
1. .5 grams of menthol was placed in 1 liter of sea water
2. beaker of menthol/sea water solution was placed on a stir plate for 10 mins and stirred at 1500 rpm using a small stir bar
3. Ice was added to the water
4. Sea cucumber is placed in beaker and allowed to sit for 30 minutes or until unresponsive to proddings

#### Notes:
Two sea cucumbers were subjected to this protocol: ~15 cm and ~40 cm long. No strong reaction was detected when placed in the solution. I did notice that the large cuke maintained a normal respiration rate by observing the anal sphincter contraction and relaxation frequency. When poked or handled they would respond with some mild body contractions or movements. When picked up they would contract and retain some regidiity but shortly would relax completely.
