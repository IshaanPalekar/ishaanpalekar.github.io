This tutorial is based on my conversation with [noodulz](https://noodulz.itch.io) creator of [Light Letters](https://noodulz.itch.io/light-letters-demo) using Rakugo.

This part will show you how to create your first scene and setup dialog.

## Included Example

In *game/Start* folder you will find a simple example scene that uses renpy markup langue:
- *Start.tscn* - example scene
- *SomeDialog.gd* - example script that extends Dialogue node

I think it will be easier to explain how dialog works by creating a scene from scratch.

## Create New Scene

### 1. Click on plus icon on top of the scene editor to create a new one

### 2. Next, choose type of scene (they can be mixed) at Scene tab

***Scene** tab is used to display and edit scene hierarchy*

I chose **2D Scene** option for this tutorial, but you can choose whichever type that fits your game.

### 3. Double-click on the new created node at Scene tab to change its name. You can choose any name when saving.

*Game objects in Godot are called "Nodes"*

I will call it *FirstScene*.

### 4. Now we can save this scene by pressing **Ctrl + S**

I save the scene as *game/SceneName/SceneName.tscn* -the *.tscn* extension is important, you shouldn't change that.

Place all resources needed by your scene in *game/SceneName* folder.

### 5. Add Our First Dialogue Node

Start by adding to scene a new Node by clicking the plus icon or **A + Ctrl**.

The window for choosing the type of node will appear, type *dialogue* (or part of it) in the search box to find it easier and click on it.

*You can click on the star icon to add it to your favorite nodes, for easier access in the future.*

Now click the *Create* button at bottom of this window.

### 6. Setup our First Dialogue for Editing

First, we should change the name of the **Dialogue** node, as there will likely be many of this kind.
I will change it name to *FirstDialogue*. To change node name, double click on it.

Next to star, to write our own dialog in it, we need to first extend it.
To do it right click on node and choose *Extend Script*.

The Create Script window will appear.

Change **Template** to *Empty*.

***Path** by default is set to save script in the same folder as the scene and the name of script is the same as the node.*

The center Godot editor window will switch to script editor.

*You can always change the mode of the editor center by clicking on the icons in the top center of the window.*

That's is all for today, next time I will explain how to start scripting your Dialogue.
