There are new [docs for Rakugo](/RakugoDocs-new).
Now it uses jekyll and fork of GDQuest's Godot-Docs_maker to genertate init verion of docs.
Generating docs don't work fully for Rakugo case, and some times godot doesn't recogizie comments as documetation.

So I welcome you to fork [docs repo](https://github.com/rakugoteam/RakugoDocs-new) and help me complete it, you just need to know markdown for this.
