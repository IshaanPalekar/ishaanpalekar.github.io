So 2020 eh! What a year.. To say the least!

Everyone knows the implications of what 2020 was all about, and the entire world watched the drama unfold. I'm going to try to stay away from the negative outcomes of 2020, and talk about nerd shit.

### What did I accomplish in 2020?

First things first; in my blog post early into 2020 I may have set my sights a bit to big, considering the *circumstances*. Alas, I did manage to see some of those goals forward, whether it be personal, or career driven. 

That being said:

- Finished my Diploma!

Starting first quarter of 2020 strong! I completed my Diploma in Information Technology! A quarter through the semester we had to quickly switch to online learning, which is a good thing I was in a technology program, as it moved quickly and pretty smooth I must say.

- Got a job as a Jr. Sys Admin

I graduated in April and applied all through the spring and summer, finally landing a gig on September 1st! I'm very fortunate to have found a great first job in my field, where I have excellent mentorship within the small IT team I work in. I'm continuously learning and feel as though the opportunities are limitless!

- Moved out

More of the personal side of things. But I did it and I'm now wondering how toilet paper and dish soap is so expensive..

### Onwards

Those were my main goals that I completed in 2020. Of course there were smaller victories and there will continue to be in 2021.

My (professional) hopes for 2021:

- Continue to learn basic IT skills through my current role.

- Continue to work on my homelab to hone more skills.

- Go down a certification path (Azure, devops, security).

I take things in strides and the larger ups for me in 2020 outweighed the other evils of the year. Here's to a successful and prosperous 2021.
