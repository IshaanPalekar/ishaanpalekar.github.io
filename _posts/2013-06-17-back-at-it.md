## Hello!

So, *finally* time to start blogging again.  Welcome to the [Next Generation of My Insanityâ„¢](http://www.crandallnet.com). 

I am going to start over (again) using [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) instead of some other CMS.  I think that Octopress provides less distractions doing things that are (seemingly) fun but are not what am intending to do, (i.e. [yak shaving](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving)) rather than doing what I am supposed to be doing (writing.)

As always, check out the [about](/about) page for information about me, and the [contact](/contact) page for how to get a hold of me.

Cheers!
