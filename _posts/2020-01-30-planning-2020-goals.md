### My goals for 2020 in tech

2019 was a great year of learning what specific areas of the field I'm really interested in.
Luckily I'm in a program that allows me to experience a wide area of the tech field, including; 

- Linux server management/scripting
- Networking/routing/switching
- Object Oriented Programming
- Virtualization
- Windows Server management
- Android app development

My interests lie in a Operations/'Devops' role. I'm very keen on IoT, cloud functions & platforms mainly Azure and AWS, 
and deploying applications, databases, and networks from these platforms work and how to secure them and prevent potential threats
to these systems.

- The main goal is finishing my Diploma in Information Technology and Applied systems.

- I want to achieve the [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) Azure Fundamentals Certificate. Following along with 
the labs on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/), and some online recourses and textbooks to achieve this.

- Finishing a MVP on an android app 

- Applying to continue my studies for a Bachaelors in Technology

- Gain more valuable work experience to further my knowledge 

- Continue enhancing my programming concepts

Some of these goals are somewhat general, but obtainable if I keep on track and always be eager to learn.
