Getting my hands on old hardware is a perfect excuse to start a homelab. What's the point in having one of these? It's a great way to learn new technologies in a sandbox environment, there's no worrying about things breaking here. It's also a nice way to set up infrastructure and software how you like it without the constraints of an employer or business. 

This is just the beginning for me, but it's a great way to start practicing skills and learning new ones. I've moved all of my Plex services running on Docker containers from my Raspberry Pi, to my new Optiplex server. Although it the Pi was working it was definitely on the heavy-loaded side, especially trasncoding. 

Here's a look at the network/hardware infrastructure so far:

It's basic, but for what I need to do it works well. Maybe in the near future I can look into upgrading to some enterprise grade equipment ;).
