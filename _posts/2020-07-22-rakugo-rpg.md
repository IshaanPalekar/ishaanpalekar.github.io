As you can see this site have new page **Extensions**.

## Extensions

Are addons to rakugo or to your rakugo game.
_Addons for your game_ are mean mostly to be modifed to fit your game.
And this is way I decided to called them this way.
I will propobly make extesions for _Click & Point Adventure_ and _Graphic Editor Dialog_.
But before that I need to change/add few things in Rakugo itself.

## Rakugo RPG:

It Adds:

- **RPGCharacter** - extension of **Character** Node
- **Combat System**

## What about other RPG mechanics?

- *Quest System* is already part of Rakugo
- other rpg machanics will be added in next updates of this extension

## How To install:
- First you need [Rakugo 2.1.05]()
- I just unpack zip to _res://game_ folder
- Start modifing it to fit your game

## How I can modify

### Here I will put video tutorial soon.
