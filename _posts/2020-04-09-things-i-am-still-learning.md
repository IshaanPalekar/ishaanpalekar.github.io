Hi, my name is Ken Crandall.  Today I turn 46.  _I am a work in progres..._

The past few years have been really relavatory to me, personally.  I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 40.  It was a real eye-opener -- not just in terms of explaining a lot of _why_ I am the way I am, but also why things that seemed so easy for others seemed so difficult to me.  It conincided with the diagnosis of my son, as well, and it has been a journey of mutual learning for us, and something we have actually bonded over.  It is at the same time a shared condition but an individual challenge for both of us.  It is also a big challenge for our loved ones.  

I have also had other challenges, recently.  They are personal, so I'm not going to share details, but it is sufficient to say that I am still learning how to be me, and how to be the best version of myself.

Now we all share the challenges that COVID-19 is presenting to us -- both as individuals, and as a society.  As we go through this journey together, I hope it is one where we can all continue to learn about ourselves and learn how to work together during this challenge.

I guess we are _ALL_ works in progress...
