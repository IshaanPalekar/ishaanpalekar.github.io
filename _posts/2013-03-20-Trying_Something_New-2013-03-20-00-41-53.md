Trying Something New
---
_This is my new, shiny automated blog workflow._

Here's how it works:

1. It uses Drafts on iOS for me to write in Markdown.
2. I created a custom Drafts Dropbox action to generate all the fun Octopress/Jekyll _post nonsense
3. ...
4. Profit!

Hopefully I can find something nearly as useful for OS X, then I will write __much__ more often.
