I was initially trained in Paris at [Lycée Saint-Louis](https://lycee-saintlouis.fr/) (2013-15) and [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) (2015-17) where I earned a BSc and a french Diplôme d’ingénieur (MSc) studying mainly mathematics and statistics, but also a bit of theoretical physics and economics. During these years, I interned as a Data Scientist at [Sidetrade](https://www.sidetrade.com) (Paris) and Amazon EU (Luxembourg).

In 2017, I headed to the University of Oxford where I completed an [MSc in Statistics and Machine Learning](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/study-here/taught-postgraduate/msc-in-statistical-science/) (with Distinction).
My Master’s thesis focused on developing a Bayesian tree-based algorithm to predict the length of hospital stays for patients, working with [Professor Mihaela van der Schaar](http://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/).

I joined the [Inouye Lab](http://www.inouyelab.org/) and the University of Cambridge in 2018 after my graduation for a PhD in Health Data Science.
