My name is Carlos Salgado and I live in London, Canada. I'm an electrical and computer engineer **(M.E.Sc. '2018)** and a mechatronics engineer **(B.Eng. '2011)** with over 6 years of professional experience in manufacturing and repair environments.

I have broad interests ranging from robotics, mechatronics, medical devices, embedded systems, software and signal processing (audio, imaging and video). As the enthusiast that I am I use my spare time to learn about these technologies. Feel free to contact me about related work or volunteering opportunities.
