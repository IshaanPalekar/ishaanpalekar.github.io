My name is Carlos Salgado and I live in London, Canada. I'm an electrical and computer engineer (M.E.Sc.'2018) and a mechatronics engineer (B.Eng.'2011). I have broad professional interests ranging from robotics, mechatronics, medical devices, embedded systems, software and signal processing (audio, imaging and video).
