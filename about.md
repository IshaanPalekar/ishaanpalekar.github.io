My name is Carlos Salgado and I live in London, Canada. I'm an electrical and computer engineer **(M.E.Sc. '2018)** and a mechatronics engineer **(B.Eng. '2011)** with over 6 years of professional experience in manufacturing and repair environments.

I have broad interests ranging from robotics, mechatronics, medical devices, embedded systems, software and signal processing (audio, imaging and video). As the enthusiast that I am I use my spare time to learn about these technologies. 

Feel free to use the menu to contact me about work opportunities, volunteering or tech events as well as other subjects such as feedback about the site.
