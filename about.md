I was initially trained in Paris (France) at [Lycée Saint-Louis](https://lycee-saintlouis.fr/) (2013-15) and [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) (2015-17), where I earned a BSc and a french _Diplôme d’ingénieur_ (MSc) studying mainly mathematics and statistics, but also theoretical physics and economics. During these years, I interned as a Data Scientist at [Sidetrade](https://www.sidetrade.com) (Paris) and Amazon EU (Luxembourg).

In 2017, I headed to the University of Oxford, where I completed an [MSc in Statistics and Machine Learning](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/study-here/taught-postgraduate/msc-in-statistical-science/) (with Distinction).
My Master’s thesis focused on developing a Bayesian tree-based algorithm to predict the length of hospital stays for patients, working with [Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar](http://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/).

I joined the [Inouye Lab](http://www.inouyelab.org/) and the University of Cambridge in 2018 after my graduation for a PhD in Health Data Science supervised by Prof. Mike Inouye.

I'm supported by the [MRC Doctoral Training Program](https://mrc.ukri.org/skills-careers/studentships/how-we-fund-studentships/doctoral-training-partnerships-dtps/) through the Industrial Strategy PhD studentship in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, and [HDR-UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk). At the University of Cambridge, I'm based in the [BHF Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/ceu/) and the [Cambridge Baker System Genomic Initiative](https://sysgenresearch.org) in the Department of Public Health and Primary Care (School of Clinical Medicine). I'm also a member of [Clare Hall College](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk).

Outside of work, I'm involved with the [Cambridge University Modern Pentathlon Club](https://cumpc.soc.srcf.net) (and previously with [OUMPA](https://www.oumpa.org)). I also enjoy photography, tennis...
