### Future changes in the protocols page
I recently stumbled across an excellent resource for creating, maintaining, and sharing protocols. So I will use that website
rather then write all the protocols out here. With that being said, it means I will need to rethink and change some of my website 
design and I am too lazy to do that at the moment. Instead, below is a link to the protocols website. The user has to sign in 
in order to see my profile. I have not "published" any of the protocols so they are currently "private" and inaccessible for now.
