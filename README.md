## How to edit the MRSHub website (MRSHub.org)

1. Clone the 'develop' branch to a folder of your choice on your computer.

2. Make changes to files as you see fit.

3. To test the changes you made locally, open a terminal or prompt, navigate to the folder you just created (so you can see the file `_config.yml`).

4. Type the command `jekyll serve` and hit Enter.

5. After a while, you should see a line `Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/`. You can copy the address into your web browser and test the functionality of the local copy of the site. In the terminal window, hitting Ctrl-C will stop the Jekyll server.
