###### Note 1 : Depending on your Internet connection, `bundle exec jekyll serve` commend may take 20 to 100 seconds or over.
###### Note 2 : If you are in Windows, you can get caughted in ` Invalid CP949 character "\xE2" on line 54 ` Error. Just type `chcp 65001` before type `bundle exec jekyll serve`. (Unfortunatly Git bash can understand `chcp` commend. Use CMD and the others.)
