Joy Buolamwini’s work uncovered racially discriminatory patterns in facial recognition datasets and software systems – only when wearing a white mask would the system recognize her as a human being. Her organization, the Algorithmic Justice League, was established to fight this problem of algorithmic bias, which she terms ‘the coded gaze’. In this blogpost I want to discuss the way in which this injustice constitutes an additional, specific harm that can be considered epistemic in nature, drawing on what Miranda Fricker coined, in her book Epistemic Injustice: Power & the Ethics of Knowing (2007), a <strong>hermeneutical injustice</strong>:

> [T]he injustice of having some significant area of one’s social experience obscured from collective understanding owing to hermeneutical marginalization. (Fricker, 158)

The term ‘coded gaze’ might not have been the only, or even the first, term for the phenomenon it seeks to describe. While these terms may seem like mere terminology, it’s important to realize the underlying concepts and corresponding words, our ‘hermeneutical resources’, are not neutral. They reflect power structures and can therefore also reinforce or disband those structures. And as with all exercise of power, there is potential for either justice or injustice. Hermeneutical injustice, Fricker argues, forms a specific harm (and moral wrong) that deprives disadvantaged parties of the conceptual tools needed to make sense of their experiences, and consequently makes it impossible for them to render these experiences intelligible to others or to argue against any wrongs committed against them as a result. Being deprived of the possibility of ‘making sense of one’s own experiences’ and the consequences tied to that capacity, including the very construction of selfhood, are what constitute the ultimate wrong in hermeneutical injustice:

> The primary epistemic harm done to [her] was that a patch of her social experience which it was very much in her interest to understand was not collectively understood and so remained barely intelligible, even to her (Fricker, 162)
