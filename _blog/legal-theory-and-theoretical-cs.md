This project will dive head-on into the assumptions of data-driven and code-driven law, to unearth their implications for the protection that law and the Rule of Law aim to offer. To situate, understand and describe such assumptions, the COHUBICOL research team will have to start a conversation with those versed in the theoretical underpinnings of computer science. It is only while interacting with CS that we will be able to come to terms with crucial differences between the text-driven nature of modern positive law (and the legal protection it provides) and algorithmic decision making.
