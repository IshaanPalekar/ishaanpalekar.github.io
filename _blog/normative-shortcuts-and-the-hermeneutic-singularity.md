<strong>Legal normativity</strong> is an important theme for COHUBICOL, particularly how its nature might change when the medium that embodies it moves from text to code- and data-driven systems. Normativity is a useful concept in thinking about the role of law and of legal systems; it refers to the <strong>purposive force of (textual) legal instruments and rulings</strong> that, subject to their interpretation and potential contestation, require citizens to act (or not act) in certain ways.

Importantly, however, normativity arises not just from legal instruments and rulings. <strong>How we act and behave are impacted by many other forces</strong> which might be purposive, coercive, or even unknown to us. Although it is not without certain limitations, Lessig’s influential analysis of four ‘regulatory modalities’ – social norms, the market, architecture/software code, and law (Lessig 2006) – gives a basic sense of how our actions are impacted by multiple external forces, sometimes acting concurrently and/or in concert with one another. This existence of alternative sources of normativity is important to bear in mind, especially where they <strong>lack the public and democratic character of law</strong> (Hildebrandt 2008). In this blog post I want to propose the concept of the <strong>’normative shortcut’</strong> as a means to better understand the consequences of software code that lacks these characteristics. I'll then speculate on the idea of the <strong>’hermeneutic singularity’</strong> as one such potential consequence in the field of legal analytics.

## Narrow and broad normativity
