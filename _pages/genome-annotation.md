Genome Annotation is a complex and difficult task. Below are some tools for annotation.

### Repeat Annotating and Masking

[RepeatMasker](http://repeatmasker.org/) is a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The output of the program is a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query sequence as well as a modified version of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked.  

### Gene Annotation 

[Augustus](http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/) is a program that predicts genes in eukaryotic genomic sequences.  
[Braker](http://exon.gatech.edu/braker1.html) is a pipeline for fully automated prediction of protein coding genes with GeneMark-ES/ET and AUGUSTUS in novel eukaryotic genomes   
[Genemark](http://exon.gatech.edu/GeneMark/) is a family of gene prediction programs.  
[Maker2](http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html) is a portable and easily configurable genome annotation pipeline.
