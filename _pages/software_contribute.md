# Sharing code

Contributing useful code that you wrote to solve a recurring task is a great way to...
* assist the community in creating tools and propel transparent science.
* avoid duplication of efforts.
* get credit for your work.
* gain recognition of your name and familiarity with your work.

# Submission guidelines

There are three easy ways to submit your work for being featured on the MRSHub: e-mail, the MRSHub forum, or directly via GitHub.

When submitting your code through any of these three pathways, please attach basic information by filling in the following template. We will use this information to generate the entry for your contribution on the MRSHub software page.
- **Developer**: The name(s) you want to credit with development. (MANDATORY)
- **Name of the software**: The name of the software/piece of code. (MANDATORY)
- **Abstract**: A brief abstract of the purpose, scope, and functions of the code you contribute. (MANDATORY)
- **Language**: The programming language of your contribution (MANDATORY)
- **Credit**: Indicate how you would like to be credited for your software - for example, if a certain publication should be cited, or whether you would like to be acknowledged in publications using your code. (OPTIONAL)
- **Contact**: A way you can be contacted, for example an e-mail address, the website of your lab, or your LinkedIn/Researchgate/Google Scholar page. (OPTIONAL)

## Submitting through e-mail

Send an e-mail with the basic submission information and either a .zip file containing the code folder and example data, or include a link to a file hoster where we can access it. We will then create a repository for your submission in the [MRSHub GitHub account](https://github.com/mrshub).

## Submitting through the MRSHub forum

Create a new topic in the [MRSHub forum](https://forum.mrshub.org) with the basic submission information. Preface the title of the topic with [CODE SUBMISSION]. Upload a .zip file containing the code folder and example data to a file hoster where we can access it, and include the link in your topic. We will then create a repository for your submission in the [MRSHub GitHub account](https://github.com/mrshub).

## Submitting directly via GitHub

Create a new topic in the [MRSHub forum](https://forum.mrshub.org) with a link to your repository. Include a README.md file containing the basic submission information. We will fork the repository into the [MRSHub GitHub account](https://github.com/mrshub). Whenever you update your own repository and wish to have the new features included in the MRSHub repository, let us know through the forum topic associated with your submission, and we will pull the changes.

# Good coding practices

We understand that most MRSHub users and contributors will be MR physicists, neuroscientists, or clinical researchers first, and code developers second. Any line of code can potentially be useful to someone else. Don't fret if you think your code "isn't perfect"! If you can save someone else a chunk of time they'd otherwise spend duplicating your effort, your code is good enough!

To maximize the impact and usability of your submission, please try and make your code as generalizable, readable, and understandable as you can. Annotate and comment as much of your code as possible. Provide an example dataset along the code itself, and show the output of your code so users know what the code is supposed to accomplish.

Many programmers have written about good coding practices:
