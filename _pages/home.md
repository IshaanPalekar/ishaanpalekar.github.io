Rakugo Framework is inspired by [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org) game template with addon for story driven games in [Godot](https://godotengine.org) like visual novels, point & click and rpg, but you can mix it with other types of games.

It has dialogue system, some extra tools, nodes, gui and features that most games have out of the box. See all features [here](/features/).

The idea is to have a ready to use this framework for stories, so developers can create narrative driven games with all the amazing features and tools of Godot 3.1+.
