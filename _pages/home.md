This is a website dedicated to my studies of the Sea Cucumber *Parastichopus californicus*. In it you will find my lab notebook entries, photos of the research, dicussions about papers and other thoughts regarding sea cucumbers and my research, the protocols used, code, computational biology tools, and other bits and pieces. In this website, I hope you find something it that sparks your curiousity and gives you that "huh" moment as much as the study of this species has given me.
