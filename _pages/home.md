Rakugo Framework is inspired by [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org) game template with addon for story driven games in [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

It has dialogue system, some extra tools, nodes, gui and features that most games have auto of the box see all features [here](/features/).

The idea is to have a ready to use this framework for stories, so developers can create narrative driven games with all the amazing features and tools of Godot 3.1+.
