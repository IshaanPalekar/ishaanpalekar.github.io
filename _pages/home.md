This is a website dedicated to my studies of the Sea Cucumber *Parastichopus californicus*. In it you will find my lab notebook entries, research photos, dicussions about papers and research, the protocols used, code, computational biology tools, and other bits and pieces. I hope you find something here that sparks your curiousity and gives you that "huh" moment in the same way these strange creatures have given me pause.
