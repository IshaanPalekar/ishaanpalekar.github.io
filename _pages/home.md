Rakugo Framework is inspired by [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org) game template and framework for story driven games in [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

It has dialogue system, some extra tools, nodes, gui and features that most games have auto of the box see all features [here]().

The idea is to have a ready to use this framework for stories, so developers can create narrative driven games with all the amazing features and tools of Godot 3.1+.

Now you can support this project by buing it on [itch.io](https://jebedaia.itch.io/rakugo).

You can download 2.0 for Godot 3.1 [here](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo/releases).
