Sequencing a genome using sophisticated technology is only half of "Genome Sequencing". Current sequencing technology is capable of sequencing tiny fragments of the genome and assemblying those fragments into useable sequences is one of the primary challenges of genome sequencing.

There are a number of different approaches including aligning the fragments against the genome of a closely related species, attempting to assembly the fragments without other information, and using multiple sequencing technologies and molecular techniques. These are respectively called "Reference based genome assembly", "*de novo* genome assembly", and "Hybrid genome assembly". 

Below are links to papers, tutorials, and software used for these various approaches.
