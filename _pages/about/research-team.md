This is the website of the CoHuBiCoL research project, for which [Mireille Hildebrandt](/about/research-team/) received an Advanced Grant of the European Research Council to set up a team of both lawyers and computer scientists to conduct foundational research into computational law.

We will investigate how the prominence of counting and computation transforms many of the assumptions, operations and outcomes of the law. The research targets two types of computational law:

1. <strong>artificial legal intelligence or data-driven law</strong> (based on machine learning), and
2. <strong>cryptographic or code-driven law</strong> (based on blockchain technologies).

Both disrupt, erode and challenge conventional legal scholarship and legal practice. The core thesis of the research is that the upcoming integration of computational law into mainstream legal practice, could transform the mode of existence of law and notably of the Rule of Law.
