![](/assets/images/IMG_9855.jpg){: .align-right width="300px" height="300px"} I am a masters graduate student at Walla Walla University. While I am here my topic of study is the sea cucumber *Parastichopus californicus*. When I am not reading papers, performing experiments, or running computational analysis of its genome, I am out hiking, running, playing folks tunes on my flute, reading science fiction, and otherwise musing about the future and what it will look like.
