Hi! I'm Aidan, I'm from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. I'm a Junior Devops Developer. I work with GCP, Terraform, Shell, Grafana, Docker, and Kubernetes to ensure infrastructure is available and secure!

My interest and passion in technlogy is specifically in System Administration/Devops, scripting, automation, cloud and virtualization technologies, and Linux.

Outside of tech I enjoy the great outdoors, fitness, minimalism, travel, film, Food, beer, and I really want to get better at baking breads.
