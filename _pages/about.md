Hi! I'm Aidan, I'm from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. I'm a Junior Systems Administrator working with VMware vSphere, Windows Server, PowerShell, O365, and Azure. 

My interest and passion in technlogy is specifically in System Administration/Devops, scripting, automation, cloud and virtualization technologies, and Linux.
