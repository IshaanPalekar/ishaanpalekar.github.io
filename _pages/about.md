Hi! I'm Aidan, I'm from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. I'm a Junior Systems Administrator specializing in VMware vSphere, Windows Server, O365, and Azure. 

My interest and passion in technlogy is specifically in System Administration/Devops, scripting, automation, cloud and virtualization technologies, and Linux.

Outside of tech I enjoy the great outdoors (and indoors), fitness, minimalism, film, food and beer ( I love a good pale ale).
