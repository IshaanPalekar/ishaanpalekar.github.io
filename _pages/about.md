Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer at Quizlet.

I've been involved with [Quizlet Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quizlet.quizletandroid) since I wrote its first lines of code in 2013. As the app has grown over the years (now with over 10 million installs), I've worked to scale our product, our team, and our engineering practices.

Nowadays, I primarily focus on delivering awesome Android experiences -- both for our users and my fellow engineers.

I went to MIT, where I earned my:

- **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**, and my
- **Master of Engineering** in **Computer Science and Engineering** with a concentration in **Computer Systems**
