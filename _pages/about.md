Hi! I'm Aidan!

I'm from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. I'm an Information Technology & Applied systems Student. 

I enjoy the great outdoors (and indoors), fitness, minimalism, film, food and beer ( I love a good pale ale), and technology - specifically cloud technologies like Azure, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and the Cybersecurity field - scripting, vulnerabiliy testing, and penetration testing!
