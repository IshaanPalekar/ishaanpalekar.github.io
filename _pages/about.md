My name is Muhammad Ananda Zaidan Rizaki. I was born in Pati on 27 March 2002. I grew up in Bandar Lampung, I lived there for about 7 years before I moved to Semarang. I studied in SDN Sendangmulyo 03 and continued to SMPN 9 Semarang until 2nd grade. Then I moved once again to Banjarbaru in South Kalimantan. There I finished my Junior Highschool in SMPN 5 Banjarbaru.

Afterward, I moved to Purwokerto to study at SMK Telkom Purwokerto. Here I take Computer Networking as my main subject. 
Afterword.. My life is a bit nomadic but I greatly enjoyed it :) It gave me a lot of experience and things that I never had before.
