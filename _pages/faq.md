## Q: So it's about adding a refined writing and dialogue system to the engine?

**A:** Yes, and more - nodes, objects and funcs to make easy to provide mechanics like in visual novels, point&click and rpgs.

## Q: As a scenarist, what would I gain from using Rakugo over Ren'Py or Twine ?

**A:** It is godot addon, so you can use all godot features.
You can make your game 2d, 2.5d or 3d - you can only do 2d in Ren'Py.
You can easily add minigames or mix it with other game genre.
It will have mechanics for point & click games and rpgs - Ren'Py and Twine are only for visual novel.
This project's dialog functions can do more than Ren'Py's equivalents.

## Q: How does the framework interact with the engine ?

**A:** For now this framework is a singleton and a collection of special nodes. There is also gui included in example project that is connected with the framework and has all functions like in a Ren'Py game.

## Q: Is it easy to use ?

**A:** For now it is not that easy as I want it to be, but I am working to make it easier by implementing support for godot's visual scripting in addition to my own RakuScript which aims to make closers to programming in Ren'Py.
