## Q: So it's about adding a refined writing and dialogue system to the engine? 

**A:** Yes, and more - nodes, objects and funcs to make easy to provide mechanics like in point&click and rpgs.

## Q: As a scenarist, what would I gain from using Rakugo over Ren'Py or Twine ?

**A:** It is made as godot addon - you can use all godot features.
You can make your game 2d, 2.5d or 3d - you can only 2d in Ren'Py.
You can easy add minigames or mix it with other game genre.
It will have mechanics for point&click games and rpgs - Ren'Py and Twine are only for vn.
This project's dialog functions can do more than Ren'Py's equivalents.

## Q: How does the framework interact with the engine ?

**A:** For now this framework is a singleton and a collection of special nodes. There is also gui include in example project that is connected with the framework and has all functions like in a Ren'Py game.

## Q: Is it easy to use ?

**A:** For now it is not that easy as I want it to be, but I am working to make it use RakugoScript (this framework's own language) and visual script.
