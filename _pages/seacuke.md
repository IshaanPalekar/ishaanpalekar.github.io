In 2018, a man in Washington State was fined $1.8 million dollars for underreporting, processing, and selling illegally harvested sea cucumber. In 2017, a father and son in California were fined $17 million for smuggling sea cucumbers. So what about this strange and unfamiliar creature is so compelling people risk jail time and multi-million dollar fines? Well my friend, you have come to the right place. 

Most people on the West coast will only encounter sea cucumbers at public aquariums and in the occasional tidepool, however, sea cucumbers are a widely sought after delicacy in Eastern Asia. This may come as a suprise to many of us. I can't attest to how they taste, but I can say they have very thick and tough skin. This skin and the muscles lining the inside of the sea cucumber are what captures the appetite of some. They are either dried and fermented or served fresh often with winter melon or shittake mushrooms. In addition to their gastronomic uses, sea cucumbers are also believed to possess medicinal properties and their is some science to back that up. 

-----------------

Parastichopus californicus, common name: Californian Giant Sea Cucumber, is a large species of sea cucumber found from the coast of Baja California all the way to the farthest western Aleutian islands and into the Bering sea. Across this range is it found in waters ranging from tide pools to waters as deep as 1000 ft. 

While most people on the West coast will only encounter them at public aquariums and in the occasional tidepool, they are a widely sought after delicacy in Eastern Asia. This may come as a suprise to many of us. I can't attest to how they taste, but I can say they have very thick and tough skin. Apparently, they are tasty enough though to break the law. In 2018, a man was fined $1.8 million dollars for illegally processing  and selling ol' spikey. In 2017, a father and son were fined $17 million for smuggling sea cucumbers. 

But their gastronomic properties are not their only interesting attributes. When attacked, they will sometimes eviscerate their internal organs. In other words, they willingly cut their stomach off from their throat and then forcibly poop it out along with their intestines, respiratory tree, and reproductive organs. This may seem a bit of an over reaction as it would normally result in death for almost all other animals. For a sea cucumber, it's not that big of deal. They can regrow their internal organs. This ability has been the focus of a great deal of research as it has implications regarding our own ability to heal from internal injuries. Additionally, some sea cucumbers aestivate  or hibernate during extreme conditions such as when the water becomes too hot or too cold. This doesn't seem that interesting, until you learn they absorb their internal organs during this time and subsequently regrow them when the weather is better. Imagine if we were able to do with humans during space travel or after a traumatic internal injury? 

I am currently studying the genome of the Californian Giant sea cucumber. In order for scientists to study the underlying genetics behind their amazing abilities they need the genome of the species they are studying. Currently there is one for the Japonese Giant sea cucumber and one for the Warty sea cucumber found in southern california, but the genome of Californian Giant sea cucumber has not been sequenced not. I am hope to remedy this. If time permits, I will also investigate what genes are present and their possible functions.
