![](/assets/images/ethanol.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px" height="300px"}  DNA extraction is essential for any study investigating genetics. The fundamentals of DNA extraction are relatively simple and can actually be performed using basic household chemicals. However, researchers often require highly purified DNA for their studies and this necessitates special techniques, chemicals, and equipment. In recent years there has been an explosion in the number of commercially available DNA extraction kits which claim to reduce the time and contamination while also increasing the amount of DNA purified from each sample. If you are a poor scientist though, the tried and true old school techniques are simple and the chemicals relatively inexpensive. Below are links to some of the DNA extraction and purification methods I have looked into.
